# Jin: Your OSINT & Recon CLI Toolkit

<img src="./public/jin.png">

**Version: 1.0.0**

Jin is an open-source command-line interface (CLI) toolkit designed for OSINT (Open-Source Intelligence) and reconnaissance tasks. This project is an evolution of the original [aliftech/jin](https://github.com/aliftech/jin), which focused on ethical port scanning and DDoS attack simulation for educational purposes. Starting with version 1.0.0, Jin shifts its focus to ethical OSINT and recon activities, empowering users to gather information about targets securely and responsibly. This tool is intended for ethical and educational use only—please refrain from using it for harmful actions.

## Overview

Jin provides a suite of commands to assist with network reconnaissance, domain analysis, and vulnerability assessment. Built with Go, it is lightweight, portable, and containerizable with Docker, making it accessible for security researchers, students, and enthusiasts.

## Current Tools

- **server information**: Fetch server information and scan ports for the given URL.
- **scrape**: Scrape website data and return server info in JSON format.
- **dns**: Fetches and displays DNS records for a given domain.
- **subdomains**: Enumerates subdomains of a target domain.
- **whois**: Retrieves WHOIS data for domain registration information.
- **ssl**: Analyzes SSL/TLS certificate details.
- **robots**: Fetches and displays `robots.txt` and `sitemap.xml` data.
- **archive**: Retrieves historical snapshots from the Wayback Machine.
- **security**: Analyzes security headers of a target.
- **tech**: Detects and displays the technology stack of a website.
